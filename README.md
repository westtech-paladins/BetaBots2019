# Beta Bots 2019 Code

# Code
I wrote this in about 2.8 seconds, so don't expect it to be good or anything. This is for the beta bots 2019 competition, where we are first starting to transfer from labview to java (thank god)

# TODO
Make good code.

# LICENCE
I really don't think anyone is going to want to base their code off of this brain aneurysm.
If you want to, you can use it how ever you want. I'm not going to use GPLv3 for this.
